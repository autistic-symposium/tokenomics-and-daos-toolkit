## Tokenomics Evaluation Framework

<br>


### Supply

1. Based on supply alone, will this token hold or increase it’s value? Or will that value be inflated away?
2. How many tokens exist today?
3. How many will ever exist? (supply cap)
4. Is the issuance rate fixed or variable? If variable, what are the factors that determine (and can influence) issuance rate?
5. How was supply initially allocated among investors, community, core team, etc? Are there any group(s) with a significant holding that could drive material selling pressure upon vesting?
6. What is the vesting schedule for the largest holders?

<br>

### Demand 


<br>

1. Why would someone hold this token?
2. Is there an opportunity to earn additional return by yield farming?
3. Are earnings/fees generated from the protocol distributed back to token holders?
4. Does any rebasing take place as the protocol inflates?
5. Is there a lockup in program in place?
6. If there is a lockup program in place, what is the incremental value of rewards and what are the requirements to earn those rewards?
7. What % of total tokens outstanding are locked up?
8. How much selling pressure is generated upon lockup expiration?
9. Are there other non-monetary benefits to staking + locking up tokens (besides increasing voting power)?
